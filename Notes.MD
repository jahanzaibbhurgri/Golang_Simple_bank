//orm//
GORM: difficult as we have to learn the sql queries and it runs very slowly on high load
SQLX: convientent to use but still not approachable as failure wont occur until runtime
SQLC: APPROACHABLE: as we pass the queries and we can the built in generated code, automatic code generation
catch sql query before generating code, and full support of postgres but not of sql 

*but thou sqlx is widely used but in this sqlc because of postgres*
